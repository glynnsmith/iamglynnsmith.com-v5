<span class="p__run-in">A brilliant app from Pinkfroot that tracks air traffic throughout the world.</span> Not only that, but you can follow fights, get flight info, plane info, and a whole lot more. It's *huge*.

I was lucky enough to be brought in by Pinkfroot to rework the design of their massive iOS app, their app icon, and to polish up their large range of aeroplane and helicopter icons that fly around the globe. 

I also got to draw up a Santa Claus sprite, who they take great care to track at Christmas based on positional data from NORAD. I even wrote a short musical jingle to play when a Christmas notification pops up.
