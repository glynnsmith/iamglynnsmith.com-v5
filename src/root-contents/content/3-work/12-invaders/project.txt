<span class="p__run-in">Invaders From Beyond was an entry into the <a href="http://www.polycount.com/forum/" target="_blank">Polycount</a> "Beat Em Up" competition</span> that <a href="http://edgesize.com/" target="_blank">Pedro Amorim</a> and I teamed up for.

Our idea was designed to push us out of our comfort zones, in terms of style, specification and roles we usually fill on an art team. I used it as a project to help me learn Epic's Unreal Development Kit, the game engine we chose to construct our level in. It was a fantastic learning project.

The story for our entry begins after our player character, a young boy, falls asleep whilst watching UFO b-movies in his bedroom. The player moves through part of the character’s dream, which takes place on the set of the movie he was watching before drifting off. The game’s trajectory takes the player through the house and out into the garden, where the boy meets an alien that has crashed its spaceship through the wall of the film studio's sound stage.

Whilst Pedro worked on creating the stunning prop assets used to decorate the living room, I worked on all the world assets (floors, walls, etc) as well as all of the work inside the engine (creating shaders, kismet work, lighting, effects, animation), on top of readying the sounds, samples, and music used in the video.

I also worked on a music system that would bring in layers of elements to ramp up the tension, as you progress through the level and things start to unfold.
