<span class="p__note">Please note: The mascot image above is a redesign, so to speak, of the assets created for the project below. I've always loved these guys, and fancied a go at updating them a little. So I redrew them. I feel dizzy with power.</span>

<span class="p__run-in">BirdHive was a way for people to share links to creative projects</span> through Twitter, designed and built as a community website that would take Twitter posts tagged with a specific hashtag (#bh) and post them to the site, with poster credits, tags, etc.

This was a great project we built in the early days of Twitter, which gave me a taste of working with a community. It also afforded me the opportunity to employ my illustration skills, creating charming graphic work that instructed the user on how to use the site.
