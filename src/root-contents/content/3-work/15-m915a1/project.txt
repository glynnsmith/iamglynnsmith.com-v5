<span class="p__run-in">A set of fully articulated 3D models of the M9x class of trucks</span> used by the United States Army for haulage. The M915a1 is a tractor truck used for heavy loads, the M916 was used for light equipment transport via roads and cross-country routes, and the M920 is a tractor truck able to traverse off-road routes.

Built for military simulation applications, contracted by Simthetiq, who provide best-in-class simulation services for the civil aviation, defense and industrial fields.

This project required several LOD meshes, a damaged variant (not shown), and a texture set including diffuse, specular and ambient occlusion maps.
