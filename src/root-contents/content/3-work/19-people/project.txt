<span class="p__run-in">In tandem with the (link: ../cars text: road vehicle assets) I created for Paramics,</span> I was tasked with building a range of low polygon people, of various gender, race and size, with several variations in clothes style and colour.

These pedestrians are used in unison with road traffic simulations to discern whether crossing points, walkway sizes, intersections and crossing wait times might become issues when planning a road's overall performance and impact, right down to the optimal walk/don't walk timings of crossing lights and zebra crossings.

The simulation engine didn't support rigged meshes, so, to support animated walk cycles, I rigged each mesh to an IK bone system that I animated. I then exported each frame of the animated mesh out as a separate mesh, which the simulation engine cycles through to give the appearance of an animated pedestrian.
