<span class="p__run-in">Having completed a handful of client projects in collaboration with Redtech Software Solutions</span>, the time came to give the dusty, _old_ Redtech site a bit of an overhaul to bring it in-line with the quality of work it does for it's own clients.

We tackled this in a number of ways: by cleaning everything up, boiling everything down to the essentials, and by making it visually sharp. A responsive, single page site was designed and built, with sticky navigation to help the user swoosh up and down the page.

The first highlight was in the animations. After working through a number of methods and techniques, I drew up some inline SVG elements and animated them via CSS, resulting in a minimised file-size and maximised browser support. It's silky-smooth, and requires no dependencies. It was a fantastic learning experience, and I was very happy with how they turned out.

<div class="media__embed">
<p data-height="650" data-theme-id="31396" data-slug-hash="YwZZrM" data-default-tab="result" data-user="iamglynnsmith" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Animated Icons with SVG & CSS" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/iamglynnsmith/pen/YwZZrM/">Animated Icons with SVG & CSS</a> by Glynn Smith (<a href="https://codepen.io/iamglynnsmith">@iamglynnsmith</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
</div>

The second project highlight is the logo - a monogram initial "R" that represents code in an IDE/text editor. To the lay-person, it's a clean, interesting-looking R. If you've got that insider coder knowledge, you get the extended/hidden meaning too. A nice touch came from being able to incorporate the logo into one of the animations so, if it isn't quite clear, it's visually explained too.

The third highlight was working on the range of icons for the "What We've Built" section, each drawn up to represent the section they illustrate. I enjoy icon work immensely, and being able to draw these proved to be a great way to learn all about the SVG format. This was an SVG-"heavy" project that enabled me to learn all about best practices, tools and the benefits/drawbacks of using this format of graphics.

If you'd like to see the entire project, please do head on over to the <a href="http://redtechsolutions.co.uk/" target="blank">live site</a> and check it out.
