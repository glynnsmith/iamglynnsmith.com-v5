<span class="p__run-in">Make Machine was to be a grass-roots community platform</span> dealing with videogame art, CGI,  2D digital artwork,  and more.

The purpose of Make Machine was to provide a forward-looking platform capable of expansion, in order to host artworks, works-in-progress, articles, interviews, competitions and an intelligent help/wiki system, all to support and advance the state of digital and videogame art.

We used one brand colour, and kept the rest of the site dark, so that artwork and written passages are lifted, and made prominent.

The eventual demise of the project resulted from our super-talented, full stack coder having to take a hiatus from the project, leaving us with a skill gap we couldn't fill. This project brought the realisation that I needed to know more about development, and so began my path beyond design.
