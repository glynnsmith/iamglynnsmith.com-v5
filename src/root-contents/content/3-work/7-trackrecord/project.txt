<span class="p__run-in">I was contracted by [SI Digital](http://sidigital.co/) (Formerly Excited Atom)</span> to redesign and improve the upcoming release of their *TrackRecord 2* time-tracking software.

This project was a blast, and gave me the opportunity to touch almost all aspects of this app's design, including UI work, tiny sidebar icons, and a range of app icons, keeping it all as clean and characterful as I could.
