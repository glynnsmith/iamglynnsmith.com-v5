<span class="p__run-in">[SI Digital](http://sidigital.co/) (Formerly Excited Atom) contracted me</span> to rework their DropIn app, a productivity add-on that added a better toolset to Dropbox, the popular file-sharing application. DropIn allowed users to easily share files and screenshots via social media, and to keep track of, as well as set up filters for, project elements of specific interest to them.

I had the opportunity to rework various parts of their OS X software, including it's app logo, icons, menu bar status icons and app sales site.
