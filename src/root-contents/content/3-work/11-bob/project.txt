<span class="p__run-in">Inspired by a line from an [Aquabats song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9ozMpAkNg)</span>, this guy designed himself. The dreaded _Man With a Beard of Bees_ - with stripy jumper and a shed-made jetpack.

I'm no character artist, but I very much enjoyed building this guy up from quirky, strange ideas I'd conjured from listening to ska. Not quite finished, but we'll get there one day.

Specs: <10k tris (including bees), 1 x 1024px body texture, 1 x 512px face texture
