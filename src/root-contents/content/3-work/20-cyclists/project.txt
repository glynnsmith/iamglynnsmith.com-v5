<span class="p__run-in">Martin & Martin contracted me to build them a range of cyclists</span> after I'd completed the previous projects for Quadstone Paramics, which included the (link: ../cars text: vehicle) and (link: ../people text: pedestrian) asset packs.

The Paramics simulation engine didn't support transparency or parametric animation (rotation), so, to sell the bicycle wheels, we simply omitted the spokes completely.
