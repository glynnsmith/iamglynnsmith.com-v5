<span class="p__run-in">Fresh out of uni,</span> *We Are Not People* was meant to be an early indie videogame development collective, a project brainstormed by me and a handful of creative friends. Like anyone fresh out of uni, I had no experience with the world and thought I had the chops to put together something serious.

Alas, nearly, but not quite.

I got super-excited about the project and put together some ideas for characters, logos and a website. It wasn't meant to be, but I thought the work was neat enough to show here.
