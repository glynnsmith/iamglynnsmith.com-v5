<span class="p__run-in">This was my favourite Lumicon review</span> and hit exactly what we were aiming for. We wanted to create a game built on a somewhat simple premise, yet give it depth, and make it stand out from its competitors - a game that could be thrilling by being "masterable", but also brutally unforgiving if you're unlucky enough to muck something up.

Designed and built by both me (videogame design, visual & audio design, music) and [Nial Giacomelli](https://twitter.com/measuredweighed) (videogame design, programming), Lumicon is a tactical word game for iOS, in which players must battle time to form words, trigger combos, gain powerups and score points.

I learned a ton from this project. A lot of the work was in making animation mock-ups in Flash that Nial would then animate with code. This was a bit of a MacGuyvered workflow that proved very effective in the absence of an engine that I could directly animate within.

We also built a musical system based on loops that, when you enter different parts of the game's UI, certain elements would be brought in whilst others would be removed, creating a continuous musical bedding that sounds distinct per each UI view.
