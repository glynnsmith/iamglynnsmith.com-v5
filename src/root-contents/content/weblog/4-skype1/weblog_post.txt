Text: <span class="p__run-in">This isn’t so much a redesign,</span> since the standalone “S”-in-bubbles monogram has been in use for a long time now, but more of a farewell to the full wordmark-in-bubbles that far from being good — it was pretty atrocious, actually — was remarkably recognizable.

### In the Beginning

In its wake is a barebones wordmark in Microsoft’s corporate typeface. It’s a good move, for Microsoft at least, in that it clearly ties Skype into the Microsoft universe and puts it on the same level as its productivity software (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, et al). It clearly signals Skype isn’t the cute Danish start-up it once was. To their credit, the logo animates nicely between the monogram and the wordmark. Speaking of the animation on that video… I have no idea what’s going on… I’m either getting old or Skype is an amalgam of every social media platform out there and I can’t tell the difference apart from any of them. If you told me this was the new Snapchat or the new Instagram or the new Facebook, I would believe you.
