<span class="p__run-in"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="greetingMaker()" id="greeting"></a> I'm an all-rounder with over 12 years of diverse experience in front-end design and development.</span>

My background is mostly design-based, though the past two and a half years have seen me transition into a more hands on front-end development role. With a design background, I find I'm well-suited for the tricky details of modern front-end development.

My interests run over into other related fields including videogame design & art, visual design, animation, audio engineering, and musical composition. Front-end development is where my interests converge, and I would love to work on projects that bring these areas together.

I have a passion for learning, and I learn quickly from every project I complete. I've been lucky to work on a wide variety of projects over the years that have helped me build a solid, multi-faceted skillset that I'm always looking to improve and expand upon.

----

Summaryend:

I enjoy working with colleagues and clients to create functional, responsive sites that work well on all devices. Ideally, I'd love to work as part of a small to medium sized team of passionate and skilled people, on exciting projects that allow me to roll up my sleeves, get stuck in, and grow as a front-end developer.

I currently live on the outskirts of Bath, UK. If I might sound like a suitable candidate for your team, please don't hesistate to <a href="mailto:glynn@iamglynnsmith.com">contact me</a>. I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you very much for your consideration. <span id="message"></span>

##What's Next in the Pipe?
Animation/motion graphics, 3D, WebGL, and blazing fast performance are all where my learning aims are currently focused.

I have a good, working grasp of Javascript, with experience using frameworks like Lodash, Underscore.js, jQuery, P5.js and GSAP, and I'm working to develop a deeper, more fundamental knowledge of the language. Once I get a bit more programming experience under my belt, I'd like to begin learning one/several of the prominent UI Javascript frameworks, such as React, Angular, Vue or Polymer.

##Further Interests
Whilst I do play videogames, I'm more likely to be tinkering with building game ideas at the moment. I've a deep knowledge of both the design and art side of videogame development, and love building stuff. I am comfortable fiddling in both Unity and Unreal Engine 4. I'd like to start building games in the browser, probably with Javascript.

I love music. I also love producing music. I'm currently involved with several projects, and have managed to "release" a handful of albums, have been played on the radio, and have made soundtrack music for various indie games. I've mainly stayed with software, though I've got my eye on moving partially to analog gear: drum machines, synths, and guitars. I love the technical parts of making music, and am fascinated by the techniques, theory and production tricks used in creating modern music.
